🏥 Hospital Patient Management System

A full-stack web application designed to efficiently manage hospital patient records.
The system allows hospital staff to add, view, update, and delete patient details through a simple and interactive interface.

This project demonstrates backend API development, database integration, and frontend interface design using modern Python technologies.

🚀 Project Overview

Hospitals often face challenges in maintaining patient records manually, which can lead to data inconsistency and difficulty in accessing information quickly.

This application digitizes patient record management by providing a centralized platform where hospital staff can easily manage patient information in real time.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Backend

Python

FastAPI

SQLAlchemy

Pydantic

Frontend

Streamlit

Database

PostgreSQL

The system follows a request–response architecture where the frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend API, which processes the request and interacts with the database.

✨ Key Features

✔ Add new patient records
✔ View all admitted patients
✔ Update patient details
✔ Delete patient records
✔ Input validation and error handling
✔ Real-time database interaction
